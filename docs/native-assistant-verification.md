# Verification — October 8, 2026

- Swift core: 54 tests passed in UTC and America/Los_Angeles, including existing
  TypeScript parity fixtures and assistant/calendar policy regressions.
- Native storage/service tests: 16 passed on each isolated simulator.
- UI flows: 5 passed on iPhone 18 Pro and iPad Pro 13-inch (M5). Covers
  onboarding, conversation without tabs, explicit Save/Undo, native tools,
  disconnected calendar review, and absence of API-key entry.
- Debug simulator build and Release simulator build succeeded.
- Local Gemma 4 26B: 10/10 synthetic intent cases passed; warm requests roughly
  0.45–0.48 seconds. This measures classification, not end-to-end phone latency.
- Apple Foundation Models: the native simulator successfully classified
  “Could you help me understand my sluggishness today?” and returned the
  deterministic missing-data energy explanation. Processing ended afterward.
- Largest accessibility text size inspected in the isolated iPhone simulator;
  conversation remains scrollable, controls reachable. Final icon sizing uses
  fixed glyph sizes with labeled 44-point touch targets.

Source logs are in `/private/tmp/aurora-assistant-core-{utc,la}.log`,
`/private/tmp/aurora-assistant-tests.log`,
`/private/tmp/aurora-assistant-ipad-tests.log`,
`/private/tmp/aurora-assistant-release.log`, and
`/private/tmp/aurora-local-acceptance.json`. They are ephemeral local evidence,
not product telemetry. The reusable evaluation script is checked in.

Pending: public Google OAuth registration and live account tests; physical
HealthKit, microphone/dictation, VoiceOver, Reduce Motion, background scheduling,
touch latency, scrolling/frame rate, battery usage, signing/archive/TestFlight.
No personal calendars were changed and no credentials were created or entered.
No cloud inference occurred. Existing Aurora worktrees retain their original
heads (`a04b3dc`, `fed770d`, `165707e`).

## Input prewarming and classification cache

The follow-up Release simulator build passed. All 19 native storage/service
and cache tests plus the 5 UI flows passed on the isolated iPhone simulator.
Cache regressions cover exact request/model isolation, five-minute expiry,
least-recently-used eviction, clearing, and unsupported-response exclusion.
Logs: `/private/tmp/aurora-assistant-cache-tests.log` and
`/private/tmp/aurora-assistant-cache-release.log`.

The input-focus prewarming path compiles against the installed Apple SDK.
Its actual cold/warm latency, cache hit rate and energy impact are not measured;
use the Foundation Models instrument on physical hardware before making speed
claims. Cached classifications always route through fresh action validation
and deterministic records/time calculations.
